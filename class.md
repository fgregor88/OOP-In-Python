# Class

A class is a new custom type, but instead of being a built-in type, classes are custom types that you define.

# Object

A object is an instance of a class. For example Opel Insiagnia is an instance of an car. A tomato is an instance of a vegetable (it's not a fruid I don't care what people say ...)

# Examples

```python
class Archer:
    health = 40
    arrows = 10

legolas = Archer()
bard = Archer()

print(legolas.health)
print(bard.arrows)
```
